Hello,

I am @mprosteb, pronouns He/Him.
I am a PhD student, computational neuroscientist and electrophysiologist.
My primary fields of interest are neural communication and neural rhythms.
I love data analysis, and finding new ways of gaining insight into dense datasets.
My repository contains code written for published scientific manuscripts, as well as side projects involving signal processing and some game design. 
You can reach me at mprosteb@ualberta.ca. Feel free to reach out for answers to questions about my code, research, or to request an updated feature to the code.
